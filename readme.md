#### newtab lyrics
enter a set of artist names and everytime you open a new tab, their lyrics will appear

#### scrap ideas
- can't use node.js as I wanted to
- might just switch to a flask REST API and have a website point to it
    - have to store a local cookie to keep track of artists and already seen lyrics
- have a thumbs up and thumbs down
- when a user inputs an artist's name, download 100 songs to the server to speed up retrevial in the future
- store each lyric with a rating next to it
